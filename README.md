Tic-Tac-Toe

This program is a run through of the game Tic-Tac-Toe. There is a game board numbered 1-9 and two players: X and O. Each turn, the current player chooses a number on the board to insert an X (or an O) on that space. The play continues until the first player gets three X's (or O's) in a row across, down, or diagonally. If neither player is able to get three in a row, then the game ends in a draw.
